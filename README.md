OVERVIEW

Today, number of students face challenges when studying calculus. It is hard to remember all the stuff that instructor assigns in one or two semester. As a result, knowledge that they gain can be easly forgotten. Also, students face difficulty for studying before exams becuase they have to review a lot of stuff which is not efficiently collected into one reliable source.

My Calculus Dictionary app will help students to study calculus more efficiently. It will have everything necessary for students to remember what the instructor said during the class and will help them a lot to prepare for the exams.

Sometimes it is difficult for the instructors two explain all the proofs of the theorems because of the limited time. My application will provide proofs and even go deeper in to details by explaining corollories. It will be very useful for students who want deeper understanding of calculus.
